DESCRIPTION:

Events are stored where both tau leptons decay hadronically. The following tauID selections are applied:

tau_byVVVLooseDeepTau2017v2p1VSjet
tau_byVVVLooseDeepTau2017v2p1VSe
tau_byVLooseDeepTau2017v2p1VSmu

The following b-tag selections are used:

pfDeepCSVJetTags:probb
pfDeepCSVJetTags:probbb
btagCut = 0.4941

The following JEC were used:

jetCorrections = ('AK4PFchs', cms.vstring(['L1FastJet', 'L2Relative', 'L3Absolute', 'L2L3Residual']), 'None')

TauSpinner weights are not stored yet.
The trigger scale factors and tau id scale factors used are for mva17_v2 and not for deep tau.
